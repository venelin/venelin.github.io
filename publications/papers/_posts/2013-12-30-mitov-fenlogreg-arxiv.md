# Abstract

Multi-task learning has shown to significantly enhance the perfor-
mance of multiple related learning tasks in a variety of situations. We
present the fused logistic regression, a sparse multi-task learning ap-
proach for binary classification. Specifically, we introduce sparsity in-
ducing penalties over parameter differences of related logistic regression
models to encode similarity across related tasks. The resulting joint learn-
ing task is cast into a form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with
a recursive variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We
show results on synthetic data and describe the regime of settings where
our multitask approach achieves significant improvements over the single
task learning approach and discuss the implications on applying the fused
logistic regression in different real world settings.
