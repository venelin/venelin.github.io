PCMFit: Statistical inference of phylogenetic comparative models

</h1>

The goal of PCMFit is to provide a generic tool for inference and
selection of phylogenetic comparative models (PCMs). Currently, the
package implements Gaussian and mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models
(MGPM) over all tree types (including non-ultrametric and polytomic
trees). The package supports non-existing traits or missing measurements
for some of the traits on some of the species. The package supports
specifying measurement error associated with each tip of the tree or
inferring a measurement error parameter for a group of tips. The
Gaussian phylogenetic models include various parametrizations of
Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) multivariate branching
processes. The mixed Gaussian models represent models with shifts in the
model parameters as well as the type of model at points of the tree.
Each shift-point is described as a pair of a shift-node and associated
type of model (e.g. OU or BM) driving the trait evolution from the
beginning of the branch leading to the shift-node toward the shift-node
and its descendants until reaching a tip or another shift-point. The
function PCMFit is used to fit a given PCM or a MGPM for a given tree
with specified shift-points. The function PCMFitMixed is used to fit an
ensemble of possible MGPMs over a tree for which the shift-points are
unknown. This function can perform model selection of the best MGPM for
a given tree and data according to an information loss function such as
the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The package has been thoroughly
tested and applied to real data in the related research article (Mitov,
Bartoszek, and Stadler 2019) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1813823116>. Currently,
the package is available from <https://github.com/venelin/PCMFit>. The
web-page <https://venelin.github.io/PCMFit/> provides access to
documentation and related
resources.

<!--An early version of this article is available in Chapter 7 of the doctoral thesis available at <https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000315296>. -->

# Prerequisites

Before installing PCMFit, it is necessary to ensure that several
R-packages are installed or can be installed from CRAN. These are listed
below:

  - [PCMBase](https://venelin.github.io/PCMBase). The PCMBase package is
    available on CRAN and should be installed automatically during the
    installation of PCMFit. If this does not happen, try the command:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
install.packages("PCMBase")
```

  - \[[PCMBaseCpp](https://github.com/venelin/PCMBaseCpp)\]. This
    package contains Rcpp modules for likelihood calculation of the
    model types implemented in PCMBase. PCMBaseCpp can be used as a
    companion and not a substitute of PCMBase. The sole purpose of
    PCMBaseCpp is to accelerate the likelihood calculation by
    implementing the most computationally intensive algorithm in C++,
    which has shown a dramatic speed-up (in the order of 100 times)
    (Mitov et al. 2018). Hence, installing this package is optional but
    highly recommended, in particular, if the goal is to infer models
    with shifts and/or to infer models on trees bigger than 100 tips.
    Installing PCMBaseCpp requires a C++ compiler to be installed on the
    system. This installation has been tested on two systems:
    
      - On Mac OS X, it has been tested using the default (clang) and
        the Intel (icpc) compiler.
      - On Linux (Euler ETH cluster), it has been tested with the
        following modules loaded (commands in the file `.bashrc`):

<!-- end list -->

``` sh
module load interconnect/ethernet
module load new gcc/6.3.0 open_mpi/1.6.5 r/3.4.0 intel/2017.5
```

``` sh
xcode-select --install
```

Upon validating the availability of a C++ compiler, PCMBaseCpp can be
installed using the commands:

``` r
# These two packages are available on CRAN
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("RcppArmadillo")
# At the time of writing, PCMBaseCpp is available only from github. 
devtools::install_github("venelin/PCMBaseCpp")
```

  - other third party dependencies include the packages
    [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table),
    [`foreach`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach),
    [`iterators`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iterators),
    [`ape`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ape) and
    [`digest`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=digest). These
    packages should be installed automatically from CRAN when installing
    PCMFit. If this does not happen, consult the packages’ web-pages
    (links above).

  - An optional but highly recommended dependency. The function
    `PCMTreePlot` in the package PCMBase uses the R-package ggtree,
    which is not on CRAN. It is highly recommended to install this
    package in order to be able to visualize trees with colored parts
    corresponding to defferent evolutionary regimes. If `ggtree` is not
    installed, the figures in the vignettes and coding examples cannot
    be generated. At the time of writing this documentation, `ggtree`
    can be installed from bioconductor through the following code (if
    that does not work, check the [ggtree home
    page](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/)):

<!-- end list -->

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ggtree", version = "3.8")
```

# Installing PCMFit

## From Github

Currently the package can be installed from github using the command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("venelin/PCMFit")
```

## From CRAN

Publishing PCMFit on CRAN is planned after release of the first stable
and documented version.

# Parallel execution

Currently PCMFit implements parallel execution for the inference of
mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models with unknown shifts. This is optional
but highly recommended. To enable parallel execution, it is necessary to
run PCMFit on a computer equipped with a multiple core processor or on
multiple node computing cluster. In its current implementation, PCMFit
uses the function `%dopar%` from the R-package
[`foreach`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach) to parallelize
the execution of (nested) `foreach` loops. This parallelization has been
tested using two parallel backends for the `%dopar%` function:

  - Using the R packages
    [`doMPI`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doMPI) and
    [`Rmpi`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rmpi) on a multiple node
    cluster with `open_mpi/1.6.5` installed. In particular, MGPM
    inference has been run using up to 250 cores on the [ETH scientific
    computing cluster Euler](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Euler).
  - Using the R package
    [`doParallel`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doParallel) on a
    MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7
    processor (4 physical cores, 8 logical cores), running macOS Sierra
    10.12.6.

To install the above packages, follow the most recent instructions in
their documentation (links to the packages web-pages provided above).
Once you have installed the parallel backend of choice, you can
paste/edit the following code snippet in the beginning of the R-script
for running PCMFit model inference:

``` r
library(PCMBase)
library(PCMBaseCpp)
library(PCMFit)
# other needed packages, e.g. ape, data.table etc...

# extract dataset identifier and possibly other parameters from the command line:
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
if(length(args) > 0) {
  data_id <- as.integer(args[1])
} else {
  data_id <- 1L
}

# A character string used in filenames for a model inference on a given data:
prefixFiles = paste0("MGPM_A_F_BC2_RR_DATAID_", data_id)


# creating the cluster for this PCMFit run:
if(!exists("cluster") || is.null(cluster)) {
  if(require(doMPI)) {
    # using MPI cluster as distributed node cluster (possibly running on a 
    # cluster of multiple nodes)
    # Get the number of cores. Assume this is run in a batch job.
    p = strtoi(Sys.getenv('LSB_DJOB_NUMPROC'))
    cluster <- startMPIcluster(count = p-1, verbose = TRUE)
    doMPI::registerDoMPI(cluster)
  } else {
    # possibly running on personal computer without mpi installation
    cluster <- parallel::makeCluster(
      parallel::detectCores(logical = TRUE),
      outfile = paste0("log_", prefixFiles, ".txt"))
    doParallel::registerDoParallel(cluster)
  }
}
```

Finally, to tell PCMFit that it should run the inference in parallel,
specify the argument `doParallel=TRUE` in calls to the function
`PCMFitMixed`. A full example for this is provided in the user guide
[Inferring an MGPM with Unknown
Shifts](https://venelin.github.io/PCMFit/articles/pcmfitmixed.html).

# Resources

A brief historical background and theoretical overview of PCMs can be
found in Chapter 1 of (Mitov 2018a). A more general introduction can be
found in (Harmon 2018). The research article “Automatic Generation of
Evolutionary Hypotheses using Mixed Gaussian Phylogenetic Models”
provides a general introduction to MGPMs and reports a real data example
and a simulation based comparison of MGPMs versus other implementations
of phylogenetic comparative models with shifts. The article is currently
undergoing peer review for a publication.

The user guides and technical reference for the library are available on
the [PCMFit web-page](https://venelin.github.io/PCMFit/):

**Note:** *The writing of the user gudes and [help
articles](https://venelin.github.io/PCMFit/reference/index.html) for
this package is in progress. Please, contact the author for assistance,
in case you need to use PCMFit right away and need help with the coding
examples. Thanks for your understanding.*

# Related tools

PCMFit builds on top of a stack of three tools enabling fast likelihood
calculation and simulation of MGPMs:

  - The R-package [PCMBase](https://venelin.github.io/PCMBase/)
    implements the specification, likelihood calculation and simulation
    of MGPMs (Mitov et al. 2018).
  - The auxiliary package
    [PCMBaseCpp](https://github.com/venelin/PCMBaseCpp) provides a fast
    C++ implementation of the likelihood calculation as described in
    (Mitov et al. 2018).
  - PCMBaseCpp relies on the C++ library
    [SPLITT](https://github.com/venelin/SPLITT) implementing fast
    traversal of phylogenetic trees (Mitov and Stadler 2018).
